# Appscrip-task--Satyam-Sundram-
This project is a responsive e-commerce demo website built using Next.js, leveraging Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to enhance performance and SEO. The application integrates with the FakeStoreAPI to display mock products dynamically. Key features include optimized SEO settings (customizable page title, description, schema, H1/H2 tags, alt text for images), a mobile-first responsive design for seamless usability across devices, and minimal use of pre-built JavaScript packages to ensure efficient performance. The code follows clean and structured conventions with an emphasis on simplicity and maintainability. The website is hosted on Netlify for public access and has been optimized for fast loading times and a user-friendly interface.
